# LanguageTranslationService

A Multi Language Translation App


In the era of globalization, the ability to break language barriers is more crucial
than ever. This report presents the development of a state-of-the-art neural machine
translation service, designed to translate text between Romanian to English and
French to English. Leveraging the rich linguistic resources and the comprehen-
sive proceedings of the Europarl corpus Datasets, this service employs advanced
natural language processing techniques. The project delineates the deployment of
sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models, including RNNs with GRUs, attention
mechanisms, and cutting-edge transformer models. This detailed exploration not
only charts the methodical data collection and preprocessing efforts but also the
iterative optimization and fine-tuning of these models. The culmination of this
work is a robust translation service, the efficacy of which is meticulously evaluated
and documented, showcasing the profound skills acquired in Python programming
and sequence-to-sequence model architecture throughout this endeavor.
